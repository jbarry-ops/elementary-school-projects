# elementary-school-projects
These are some of my oldest ROBLOX lua projects, from a backup of my mom's computer.
They are from my early days of programming, when I was in elementary school (~10 years old). 
Although I would now be somewhat embarrassed at their contents, they are an accurate representation of my programming experience and abilities at the time.
